# TheBirthdaysApp
TheBirthdaysApp

Clone the repo and try to run the App.

Please note:
A plugin was used to generate data classes from JSON
Some boilerplate code was added for a resource class and some basic retrofit error handling from another project. Some other code also copied from my own projects to save time.


If I had more time:
Make sure the repository is injected using Dagger-Hilt. I.e. dependency injection
Add a progressbar
Implement DiffUtil
Use strings.xml rather than hardcoding.
Would have finished the popoulation of the details view.
Get the date of birth formatted properly.
Improve the look and feel of the app.
